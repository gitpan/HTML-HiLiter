	- public release via CPAN

* 0.06
               use Text::ParseWords instead of original clumsy regexps in prep_queries()
               add support for 8211 (ndash) and 8212 (mdash) entities
               tweeked StartBound and EndBound to not match within a word
               fixed doc to reflect that debugging prints on STDOUT, not STDERR

* 0.07
               made HTML::Parser optional to allow for more flexibility with using methods
               added perldoc for previously undocumented methods
               corrected perldoc for Queries() to refer to metanames as second param
               updated SWISH::API example to avoid using HTML::Parser
               added unicode entity -> ascii equivs for better DocBook support
                       (NOTE: this expands the ndash/mdash feature from 0.06)
               misc cleanup

* 0.08
               fixed bug in SWISH::API example with ParsedWords and updated Queries()
                 perldoc to reflect the change.
               removed dependency on HTML::Entities by hardcoding all relevant entities.
                 (HTML::Entities does a 'require HTML::Parser' which made the parser=>0
                 feature break.)

* 0.09
               added Print feature to new() to allow Run() to return highlighted text instead
                 of automatically printing in a streaming fashion. Set Print=>0 to turn off print().
               Run() now returns highlighted text if Print=>0.
               changed parser=>0 to Parser=>0.
               the ParsedWords bug reported in 0.08 was really with my example in get_snippet().
                 so rather than blame someone else's code, I fixed mine... :)
               fixed bug with count of real HTML matches that was most evident with running hilite()
               added test2.t test to test the Parser=>0 feature


* 0.10
               fixed prep_queries() perldoc head
               Queries() now returns hash ref of q => regexp
               fixed SWISH::API example to use new Queries()
               fixed Queries() perldoc
               added StopWords note to prep_queries()
               fixed regexp that caused make test to fail in perl < 5.8.1 (thanks to m@perlmeister.com)
               added note to hilite() perldoc to always use Inline()
