	- public release via CPAN

* 0.06
               use Text::ParseWords instead of original clumsy regexps in prep_queries()
               add support for 8211 (ndash) and 8212 (mdash) entities
               tweeked StartBound and EndBound to not match within a word
               fixed doc to reflect that debugging prints on STDOUT, not STDERR

* 0.07
               made HTML::Parser optional to allow for more flexibility with using methods
               added perldoc for previously undocumented methods
               corrected perldoc for Queries() to refer to metanames as second param
               updated SWISH::API example to avoid using HTML::Parser
               added unicode entity -> ascii equivs for better DocBook support
                       (NOTE: this expands the ndash/mdash feature from 0.06)
               misc cleanup

* 0.08
               fixed bug in SWISH::API example with ParsedWords and updated Queries()
                 perldoc to reflect the change.
               removed dependency on HTML::Entities by hardcoding all relevant entities.
                 (HTML::Entities does a 'require HTML::Parser' which made the parser=>0
                 feature break.)
